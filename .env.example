# GitHub Organization Runner Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and replace with your actual values

# Your GitHub organization name
GITHUB_ORG=your-organization-name

# Registration Token (recommended for summerwind/actions-runner image)
# Get from: https://github.com/your-org/settings/actions/runners > New runner
# Copy the token from the --token parameter in the setup instructions
# 
# NOTE: Registration tokens expire after ~1 hour, but this is only needed for:
# - Initial container startup
# - Container recreation after being stopped
# - If you keep containers running continuously, no token updates needed!
#
# Alternative: Personal Access Token (may cause 404 errors with this image)
# Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Required scopes: repo, admin:org, workflow
#
RUNNER_TOKEN=BSYADL_your_registration_token_here

# Optional: Custom runner name (will default to container hostname if not set)
RUNNER_NAME=ephemeral-org-runner

# Runner labels (comma-separated) 
# - self-hosted: Required for self-hosted runners
# - linux: Operating system
# - docker: Indicates Docker support
# - trusted: Security label for organization-only access
# - your-org-only: Custom label to prevent fork usage (replace with your org name)
RUNNER_LABELS=linux,docker,self-hosted,trusted,your-org-only

# Security: Enable ephemeral mode (runner removes itself after each job)
# This helps with security and cleanup
RUNNER_EPHEMERAL=true

# Memory Configuration
# Docker-in-Docker service memory limit (adjust based on your server capacity)
# Examples: 2g (2GB), 4g (4GB), 6g (6GB), 8g (8GB)
DIND_MEMORY_LIMIT=6g

# Docker storage tmpfs size (should be <= DIND_MEMORY_LIMIT)
# This is RAM allocated for Docker's temporary storage
DOCKER_STORAGE_SIZE=6G

# Optional: Runner service memory limit (uncomment in docker-compose.yml to use)
# This limits the GitHub runner process itself (not the jobs it runs)
RUNNER_MEMORY_LIMIT=2g

# Token Management Strategy:
# 1. CONTINUOUS RUNNING (Recommended):
#    - Start once: docker compose up -d
#    - Leave running indefinitely
#    - No token updates needed!
#
# 2. STOP/START WORKFLOW:
#    - If stopping containers for hours: get fresh token before restart
#    - Registration tokens expire ~1 hour after generation
#    - Only needed for NEW container registration, not ongoing operation
#
# Security Notes for Open-Source Projects:
# - Uncheck "Allow public repositories" in org settings
# - Set "Repository access" to "Selected repositories" for your runner
# - Use unique labels like 'trusted' and 'your-org-only'
# - Add repository owner check in workflows: github.repository_owner == 'YourOrg'
# - Never commit your actual token to version control

# Quick Commands:
# Start runner:     docker compose up -d
# Check status:     docker compose ps
# View logs:        docker compose logs runner -f
# Stop runner:      docker compose down
# Health check:     docker compose logs runner --tail 10 | grep -E "(401|404|Invalid|Authentication)"
